# Output Formatter Tasks

## Current Issue: Medium Format Suppresses Real-time Output

### Problem Description
The Medium format currently suppresses all real-time output during execution and only shows a summary at the end. This is a regression from the original behavior where users could see progress as states are processed and actions are executed.

### Expected Behavior
- **All formats** should provide real-time feedback during execution
- **Default format**: Current behavior (detailed real-time output with Unicode box drawing)
- **Medium format**: Should provide real-time output with Medium-themed styling
- **Simple format**: Minimal real-time output (current behavior is acceptable)
- **Elaborate format**: Verbose real-time output with detailed formatting

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Default format: Provides excellent real-time feedback
- ‚úÖ Medium format: Now provides clean, professional real-time output with themed styling
- ‚úÖ Simple format: Intentionally minimal real-time output (summary-focused)
- ‚úÖ Elaborate format: Provides very detailed real-time output with comprehensive formatting

### Tasks
1. [x] Redesign Medium format real-time functions to provide themed output during execution
2. [x] Verify Elaborate format real-time functions provide themed output during execution
3. [x] Ensure all formats maintain their unique summary styling
4. [x] Verify that real-time output doesn't conflict with summary formatting
5. [x] Test all formats to ensure proper real-time feedback

## Completed Work

### Medium Format Real-time Output Implementation
- **Header**: Clean "üìã TASK EXECUTION" with separator
- **State Processing**: "‚ñ∂ Processing: [StateName] [Icon]" with prerequisites
- **Readiness Checks**: "üîç Checking: [Type] ‚Üí [Details]"
- **Check Results**: "‚úÖ Result: READY" or "‚ö†Ô∏è Result: Not ready, executing actions..."
- **Action Execution**: "üöÄ Executing actions..." with individual action progress
- **Action Progress**: "‚è≥ [ActionType]: [Description]" and "‚úÖ Completed ([Duration]s)"
- **State Completion**: "‚úÖ [StateName] completed ([Duration]s)"

### Format Behavior Summary
- **Default**: Detailed real-time output with Unicode box drawing + summary
- **Simple**: Minimal real-time output + comprehensive summary
- **Medium**: Clean real-time output with professional styling + formatted summary
- **Elaborate**: Verbose real-time output with detailed logging + comprehensive summary

### Verification Results
- All 157 Pester tests pass
- All formats provide appropriate real-time feedback
- No conflicts between real-time and summary output
- Users now see progress during long-running operations regardless of format choice

### Medium Format Spacing Fix (Latest)
- **Issue**: Missing blank line between execution flow and STATE DETAILS header in Medium format summary
- **Root Cause**: StateVisualization.psm1 was not properly handling empty string lines from formatter output
- **Fix**: Updated the output handling logic to properly write empty strings as blank lines
- **Result**: Medium format summary now correctly matches the success-medium.template with proper spacing
- **Verification**: All 157 tests still pass; spacing now matches template exactly

### Design Principles
- Real-time output should give users confidence that the system is working
- Each format should have its own visual identity for both real-time and summary output
- Real-time output should not interfere with the final summary formatting
- Users should never experience "silent" periods during long-running operations

### Implementation Notes
- Medium format real-time functions currently return $null - need to implement proper theming
- Elaborate format real-time functions currently return $null - need to implement proper theming
- Simple format intentionally returns $null for real-time (summary-focused approach)
- Default format provides the reference implementation for real-time feedback

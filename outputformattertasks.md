# Output Formatter Tasks

## Current Status: All Medium Format Issues Fixed! ✅

### Fixed Issues ✅
- ✅ **Header duplication**: Fixed - boxed header now appears only at start in real-time
- ✅ **Execution flow duplication**: Fixed - flow line now appears only in summary
- ✅ **Real-time format**: Fixed - now matches template format (`▶ stateName` instead of `▶ Processing: stateName`)
- ✅ **Check result format**: Fixed - now shows `Check: docker info → ✅ READY`
- ✅ **Dependencies format**: Fixed - no longer shows "(depends: )" for states with no dependencies
- ✅ **Real-time location**: Fixed - real-time processing now appears under "🔍 STATE DETAILS" header
- ✅ **Time lines**: Fixed - "Time: X.Xs" lines now appear correctly after each state completion

### All Issues Resolved ✅
The Medium OutputFormat is now working correctly and matches the template specification!

### Current Medium Format Behavior
1. ✅ **Header**: Shows boxed header with target immediately
2. ✅ **Section headers**: Shows "📊 EXECUTION FLOW" and "🔍 STATE DETAILS"  
3. ✅ **Real-time processing**: Shows each state as it processes:
   ```
   ▶ dockerStartup
     Check: docker info → ✅ READY
   ▶ dockerReady  
     Check: docker info → ✅ READY
   ```
4. ✅ **Summary**: Shows execution flow line and final summary
5. ❌ **Missing**: Time lines after each state

### Template Compliance
- ✅ **Format**: Matches template structure
- ✅ **Headers**: Correct headers and placement
- ✅ **Real-time content**: Correct format and location
- ❌ **Completeness**: Missing timing information

### Design Principles
- Real-time output should give users confidence that the system is working
- Each format should have its own visual identity for both real-time and summary output
- Real-time output should not interfere with the final summary formatting
- Users should never experience "silent" periods during long-running operations

### Implementation Notes
- Medium format real-time functions currently return $null - need to implement proper theming
- Elaborate format real-time functions currently return $null - need to implement proper theming
- Simple format intentionally returns $null for real-time (summary-focused approach)
- Default format provides the reference implementation for real-time feedback

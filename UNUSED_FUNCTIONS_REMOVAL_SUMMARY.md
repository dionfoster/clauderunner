# Unused Functions Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the removal of unused functions from the Claude Task Runner codebase. The analysis was performed on 2025-06-26 to identify and remove functions that were no longer in use.

## Functions Removed

### ReadinessChecks Module (`modules\ReadinessChecks.psm1`)

1. **`Test-CommandAvailable`**
   - **Purpose**: Checked if a command is available on the system using Get-Command
   - **Parameters**: CommandName (string)
   - **Usage**: Only used in tests, never called in main application logic
   - **Lines Removed**: ~25 lines including documentation

2. **`Test-ServiceRunning`**
   - **Purpose**: Executed a command to check if a service or process is running
   - **Parameters**: Command (string)
   - **Usage**: Only used in tests, never called in main application logic
   - **Lines Removed**: ~20 lines including documentation

3. **`Test-EndpointPath`**
   - **Purpose**: Checked if an API endpoint at a specific path is responding with 200 OK
   - **Parameters**: Host (string), Path (string, optional), Protocol (string, optional), TimeoutSeconds (int, optional)
   - **Usage**: Only used in tests, never called in main application logic
   - **Lines Removed**: ~30 lines including documentation

## Tests Removed

### ReadinessChecks.Tests.ps1
Removed all test contexts for the deleted functions:
- `Test-CommandAvailable for Docker` (2 tests)
- `Test-ServiceRunning for Docker` (2 tests)
- `Test-CommandAvailable for Node.js` (2 tests)
- `Test-EndpointPath for API readiness` (2 tests)
- `Test-CommandAvailable` (2 tests)
- `Test-ServiceRunning` (2 tests)
- `Test-EndpointPath` (2 tests)

**Total tests removed**: 14 tests

## Export Statement Updated
Updated the `Export-ModuleMember` statement in `ReadinessChecks.psm1` to remove references to the deleted functions:

**Before**:
```powershell
Export-ModuleMember -Function Test-WebEndpoint, Test-EndpointReadiness, Test-ContinueAfter, Test-PreCheck, Get-EndpointUri, Test-CommandAvailable, Test-ServiceRunning, Test-EndpointPath, Invoke-PollingCheck
```

**After**:
```powershell
Export-ModuleMember -Function Test-WebEndpoint, Test-EndpointReadiness, Test-ContinueAfter, Test-PreCheck, Get-EndpointUri, Invoke-PollingCheck
```

## Functions Analyzed but Retained

The following functions were initially considered for removal but were found to be in use:

1. **`Set-StateStatus`** (StateManagement.psm1) - Used via SM prefix in StateVisualization module
2. **`Register-StateAction`** (StateManagement.psm1) - Used via SM prefix in StateVisualization module
3. All StateManagement functions - Used with "SM" prefix in StateVisualization module

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- **Reduced codebase size**: Removed ~75 lines of unused code and ~140 lines of tests
- **Improved maintainability**: Fewer functions to maintain and document
- **Cleaner API**: Reduced module exports to only actively used functions
- **Faster test execution**: Removed 14 unused tests (reduced from 111 to 97 tests)

### No Breaking Changes
- All remaining functionality is preserved
- All existing tests continue to pass (97/97)
- Main application logic unchanged
- Module dependencies unchanged

## Validation

After removal:
- ✅ All 97 remaining tests pass
- ✅ Module imports work correctly
- ✅ Main application (`claude.ps1`) functions normally
- ✅ No syntax errors introduced
- ✅ Clean module exports verified

## Recommendation

The removed functions appear to have been utility functions created for potential future use but never integrated into the main application workflow. Their removal improves code clarity without affecting functionality. If these capabilities are needed in the future, they can be re-implemented as needed.

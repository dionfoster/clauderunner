~~### Complete the State Machine Visualization tests:~~

~~- Add more detailed tests for state machine functions~~
~~- Mock the necessary internal state to properly test state transitions~~

### Implement the tests for other modules:

~~- Fix the Configuration.Tests.ps1 to properly test the Load-Config function~~
- Fix the ReadinessChecks.Tests.ps1 to properly test readiness checks
- Fix the CommandExecution.Tests.ps1 to properly test command execution

### Add integration tests:

- Create tests that verify the interaction between modules
- Test the full task runner workflow

### Refactor the Logging module:

- With tests in place, you can now safely refactor to decouple state management from logging
- Split state management into a separate module if desired
